Resources for the class
=======================

Scheme
------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)

http://schemers.org/ has pointers to various tutorials.

You can use pretty much whatever implementation you want.  I'm using
````mzscheme```` which is in the Debian package ````racket````.  You
can install it on Debian (or most Debian-derived distributions, e.g.,
Ubuntu) with ````apt-get install racket````, or directly from
http://racket-lang.org/ for various other platforms.

"The Little Schemer" http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming

If you're hard core, read "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ and/or view the accompanying
lectures
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/

When you turn in a Scheme assignment, if you did it in some system
other than mzscheme, please include a comment at the top giving the
implementation so if I see constructs that won't work in mzscheme I'll
know what's going on.

Stay pure!

"Introduction to Lambda Calculus" by Henk Barendregt Erik Barendsen,
ftp://ftp.cs.kun.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf

"The Lambda Calculus", notes by Don Blaheta
http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2002/Lectures/2002-10-28-lc.pdf
gives a nice short introduction to the untyped λ Calculus that starts
with Scheme and starts simplifying and making things lazy.

Haskell
-------

"Learn you a Haskell for Great Good"
http://learnyouahaskell.com/

"Real World Haskell"
http://book.realworldhaskell.org/

Other Cool Stuff
----------------

"An Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus" by
Greg Michaelson is an excellent text.  And free.
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~brown/173/readings/LCBook.pdf

"Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages: A Laboratory
Based Approach" by Kenneth Slonneger and Bary L. Kurtz is also both
excellent and free.  http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~slonnegr/plf/Book/

"Lisp in Small Pieces" (aka the L.i.S.P. book, a translation of "Les
Langages Lisp") by Christian Queinnec
http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/WWW/LiSP.html
starts with a short Scheme interpreter and riffs its way to
denotational semantics, compilation, and an object system.
