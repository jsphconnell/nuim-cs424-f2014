Resources for the class
=======================

Scheme
------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)

http://schemers.org/ has pointers to various tutorials.

You can use pretty much whatever implementation you want.  I'm using
````mzscheme```` which is in the Debian package ````racket````.  You
can install it on Debian (or most Debian-derived distributions, e.g.,
Ubuntu) with ````apt-get install racket````, or directly from
http://racket-lang.org/ for various other platforms.

"The Little Schemer" http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming

If you're hard core, read "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ and/or view the accompanying
lectures
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/

When you turn in a Scheme assignment, if you did it in some system
other than mzscheme, please include a comment at the top giving the
implementation so if I see constructs that won't work in mzscheme I'll
know what's going on.

Stay pure!
