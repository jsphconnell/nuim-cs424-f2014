-- More Haskell!

-- "infix thing" like + or < becomes "regular" thing by surrounding
-- with parens, (+) or (<).

-- Super slow Fibonacci Numbers:
-- Type will default to Integer or Double if it can, 
-- or we can use Type Declarations (below)
-- fib1 :: Int -> Integer
-- fib1 :: Int -> Double
fib1 :: Num a => Int -> a
fib1 0 = 1
fib1 1 = 1
fib1 n = fib1 (n-1) + fib1 (n-2)

-- Faster Fibonacci Numbers via Tail Recursion:
fib2 0 = 1
fib2 n = fibTail 1 1 1 n
  where -- "where" clause allows us to locally scope things
    -- fibTail returns (fib n), but
    -- fi must be (fib i), fim1 must be (fib (i-1)), i<=n, 
    fibTail i fi fim1 n | i<n = fibTail (i+1) (fi+fim1) fi n
    fibTail i fi fim1 n | i==n = fi

-- [0..] is syntax for an infinite list of ints
-- To take 10 numbers from an infinite list of ints we can write
-- take(10) [0..]
-- Below, we're using a list to store al the fibonacci numbers
-- However, it computes each fib number separately... a bit redundant
fibs1 = map fib2 [0..]

--- Here we give it the 1st and 2nd element of the fib numbers,
--- It then computes the 3rd element by using 1st and 2nd,
--- computes the 4th element by using 2nd and 3rd element etc....
fibs2 = 1:1:(zipWith (+) fibs2 (tail fibs2))

Prelude> zipWith max [0,10,2,30,4] [3,4,5,90,1]

Prelude> zipWith + [0,10,2,30,4] [3,4,5,90,1]
HORRIBLE TYPE ERROR!!!!

  2 + 3
   is sugar for 
  (+) 2 3

  (*2)
   is sugar for
  \x->x*2
  which means the same as the Scheme: (lambda (x) (* x 2))     

"Slices": really cool, should be adopted by other languages..

type String is [Char], aka list of characters

*Main> length "foo"
3
*Main> :t length
length :: [a] -> Int

*Main> words "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
["the","quick","brown","fox","jumps","over","the","lazy","dog."]

This is efficient, even when enormousString is contents of enormous file
*Main> words enormousString !! 7
